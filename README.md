## 📅 Event Schedule (Continuous Count System)

The event runs in **three phases**, but the **completion count does NOT reset**.  
All participants who complete the challenge are added to a **running total**, and winners are selected based on this cumulative count.

| Phase | Deadline | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 🌥️ **Phase 1** | **25 November 2025** | All completions submitted before this date count toward Phase 1 rewards |
| ⚡ **Phase 2** | **5 December 2025** | Total completions so far (Phase 1 + new completions) count toward Phase 2 rewards |
| 🌩️ **Phase 3** | **31 December 2025** | Final accumulated completions count toward Phase 3 rewards |

## 🏆 Reward System (Most Important Rule)

### 🎯 **For every 10 total completions → 1 random winner**

- Applies across ALL phases  
- Count does **NOT** reset  
- Winners are chosen from the **entire completion list so far** for that phase

### Example  
- Phase 1 completions = 17 → **1 winner**  
- Phase 2 adds 8 more = 25 → **2 winners total**  
- Phase 3 adds 6 more = 31 → **3 winners total**

This ensures fairness and continuous motivation.
